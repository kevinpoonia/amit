# Authentication System Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `referred_by` column to the `users` table to store referral relationships
- Made `mobile` column unique in the `users` table
- Updated the schema file to reflect these changes

### 2. Backend API Changes
- Updated the registration endpoint (`/api/register`) to:
  - Accept username, mobile number, password, confirm password, and referral code
  - Validate that passwords match
  - Validate mobile number format (10 digits)
  - Check for existing users with the same mobile number
  - Validate referral code if provided
  - Store referral relationships in the database
  - Generate email from mobile number for compatibility

- Updated the login endpoint (`/api/login`) to:
  - Accept only mobile number and password
  - Validate mobile number format (10 digits)
  - Authenticate users based on mobile number and password

- Added a new admin login endpoint (`/api/admin/login`) to:
  - Accept mobile number '9999999999' and password 'Admin123!' as specified
  - Create an admin user if it doesn't exist
  - Ensure the admin user has the `is_admin` flag set
  - Return appropriate authentication token for admin access

### 3. Frontend Changes
- Updated the registration form to include:
  - Username field
  - Mobile number field
  - Password field
  - Confirm password field
  - Referral code field (optional)

- Updated the login form to:
  - Accept only mobile number and password
  - Include a link to the admin login page

- Added a separate admin login form with:
  - Specific placeholder text showing the required credentials
  - Direct route to admin panel upon successful authentication

- Updated state management to handle separate form data for login and registration

### 4. Migration Scripts
- Updated the database migration script to properly handle the `referred_by` column addition
- Provided SQL command for adding the column in a real Supabase environment

## Features Implemented

1. **User Registration**
   - Username, mobile number, password, and confirm password fields
   - Optional referral code field
   - Password matching validation
   - Mobile number format validation (10 digits)
   - Duplicate user prevention
   - Referral relationship storage

2. **User Login**
   - Mobile number and password authentication only
   - Mobile number format validation (10 digits)

3. **Admin Login**
   - Special endpoint for admin authentication
   - Hardcoded credentials: Mobile '9999999999', Password 'Admin123!'
   - Automatic admin user creation if not exists
   - Admin flag enforcement

4. **Referral System**
   - Storage of referral relationships in the database
   - Validation of referral codes during registration
   - Integration with user registration flow

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are stored in plain text in this implementation (should be hashed in production)
- Mobile numbers are validated for proper format
- JWT tokens are used for authentication
- Admin access is restricted to a specific endpoint with hardcoded credentials

## Testing

- Created test scripts for both user registration/login and admin login
- Verified API endpoints function as expected
- Confirmed frontend forms collect the required information

## Deployment Notes

- The database schema changes need to be applied to the production database
- The migration script provides the necessary SQL command for adding the `referred_by` column
- Environment variables should be properly configured for JWT secret and Supabase connection
