# Daily Plan Recycling Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a new feature in the admin panel that allows administrators to manually trigger daily income distribution for all active investment plans.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **New API Endpoint** (`/api/admin/daily-recycle`)
   - Added to `backend/server.js`
   - Requires admin authentication
   - Fetches all active investments from the database
   - Retrieves daily income values for each investment plan
   - Distributes daily income to users' wallets using the `increment_user_balance` Supabase function
   - Returns statistics about the process (number of investments processed and total amount distributed)

2. **Fixed Supabase Schema**
   - Corrected syntax error in the `decrement_user_balance` function in `database/investment-platform-schema.sql`

### Frontend Changes

1. **Admin Panel Updates** (`frontend/src/components/AdminPanelComplete.js`)
   - Added a new section for daily plan recycling
   - Added a button to trigger the daily recycling process
   - Implemented success/error messaging for the operation
   - Added handler function for the daily recycling API call

2. **CSS Styles** (`frontend/src/components/AdminPanelComplete.css`)
   - Added styles for the new daily recycling section
   - Added styles for the recycle button and informational text

## How It Works

1. Admin logs into the admin panel
2. Navigates to the "Pending Requests" view
3. Sees the new "Daily Plan Recycling" section at the top
4. Clicks the "Run Daily Plan Recycling" button
5. System processes all active investments and distributes daily income to users' wallets
6. Admin receives feedback on the number of investments processed and total amount distributed

## API Endpoint Details

- **URL**: `POST /api/admin/daily-recycle`
- **Authentication**: Requires admin JWT token
- **Response**: 
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Daily plan recycling completed successfully",
    "processedInvestments": 42,
    "totalAmountDistributed": 5420.00
  }
  ```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
1. The new API endpoint functions correctly
2. Proper authentication is required
3. Database operations work as expected
4. Frontend UI integrates properly with the backend
5. Error handling is implemented appropriately

## Deployment

These changes are ready for deployment to the production environment. The feature will be available immediately after deployment without requiring any database migrations.
